since my personal laptop is too old, git has some problems. 
but i can give steps here:
Create a new GitHub repository:

Go to https://github.com and log in to your account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
Enter a repository name (e.g., "playwright-cucumber-project") and optionally provide a description.
Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
Leave the remaining options as default, and click "Create repository".

Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
git init


Add the GitHub repository as a remote:

Copy the URL of your new GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/playwright-cucumber-project.git).
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/playwright-cucumber-project.git


Commit and push your project to GitHub:

Add all the project files to the Git staging area:
git add .


Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Initial commit"


Push the committed changes to the remote repository:
git push -u origin master


Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions:

In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
Click on the "New workflow" button.
Search for "Node.js" and select the "Node.js" workflow from the list.
This will create a new file in the .github/workflows/ directory of  repository.
Modify the workflow file to include the necessary steps for running  Playwright tests and generating Allure reports.



Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow file (node.js.yml) for  project:
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        npm run test
        npm run allure:report

    - name: Upload Allure reports
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: allure-results
        path: allure-report


This workflow runs on Ubuntu and tests your code against Node.js versions 14.x and 16.x. It installs the project dependencies, runs the Playwright tests, generates Allure reports, and uploads the Allure reports as an artifact.
Commit and push the changes to GitHub:

Add the new workflow file and the updated package.json file to the Git staging area:
git add .github/workflows/node.js.yml package.json



Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI"


Push the changes to the remote repository:
git push


After pushing the changes, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow on every push to the master branch and every pull request targeting the master branch. You can view the workflow execution status and logs in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
To view the Allure reports generated by the workflow, navigate to the "Actions" tab, select the specific workflow run, and then click on the "Artifacts" dropdown. You should see an artifact named "allure-results" that you can download and unzip to access the Allure reports.
